#Definitions
1. Branch: Using branches, you can securely experiment with new ideas, develop functionality, or address errors in a specific part of your repository. A branch is always made from an existing branch.
2. Clone: A repository is copied from GitHub.com to your local computer when you clone it. An whole copy of the repository's data, including all of the project's files and folders, is downloaded when a repository is cloned from GitHub.com.
3. Commit: An alteration to one or more files in your branch is recorded via a commit, which is similar to saving an edited file.
4. Git: Git is a version control tool used to monitor changes made to digital assets. It is typically employed in software development for source code management.
5. Github: GitHub is a platform for hosting code that enables collaboration and version control. It enables remote project collaboration between you and other people.
6. Merge: Multiple commit sequences will be combined into a single, unified history by merge. Git merge is most frequently employed to unite two branches.
7. Merge conflict: Merge conflicts can occur when two persons edit the same file simultaneously but make different modifications to the same line, or when one person modifies a file and another person deletes it.
8. Push: To upload content from a local repository to a remote repository, use the git push command. Commits are sent from your local repository to a remote repository via pushing.
9. Pull: Using the git pull command, you may quickly update your local repository with the content you just downloaded from a remote repository.
10. Remote: the location of your code storage
11. Repository: Your project's files and each file's revision history are all stored in a repository.
